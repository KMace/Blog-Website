            <h1 class="article-title">A Defense For the Utility of Religion</h1>
            <h2 class="article-subtitle">Does the scientific revolution necessarily entail that we no longer see the world through a religious lens?</h2>
            <div class="article-content">
                <p>It’s funny, I couldn’t have been less interested in religion as a subject whilst undergoing my high school studies. So
                much so that I dropped it! In recent years, however, I have become increasingly fascinated by the innumerable patterns
                that characterise the way in which human beings function, both collectively and individually. I can therefore no longer
                afford to ignore religion. It is the lens through which our forebears perceived the world, and it doesn't strike me as particularly likely that such a lens would just instantly dissolve in the advent of science.</p>
                
                <p>Personally, I neither espouse a religion nor believe in a God, but I think that there is a misplaced condescension in
                those who repudiate religion on the grounds that it isn't objectively true.
                <br>
                First of all, they fail to acknowledge that there is more than one type of truth, and that perhaps amongst those, in terms of
                psychological importance, objectivity ranks the lowest.
                <br>
                We are not rational creatures who see and deal with things objectively. We are, by contrast, obsessed with viewing the
                world and its events through the structure of a story: we will literally pay money to sit down and watch one for hours
                on end, despite knowing full well that it’s fictitious. While watching, we will empathise with the character, by crying
                when they encounter vicissitudes and by delighting when they are overcame. Children will beg their parents
                every night of the week to read them a story before going to bed. And, most importantly, if the story is not written properly, or
                the ending is inappropriate, we become irritated; consider the recent outrage caused by the improper finale to the ‘Game of
                Thrones’ series. Millions of people all said that the writers had completely butchered what was a brilliant and gripping
                series – and there was even a petition to have it rewritten! Why? Why do we care? And by what metric are we adjudicating
                the quality of such things?</p>
                
                <p>It is in light of our fascination with stories that I am not particularly surprised by the potency in which The Bible has had over the
                epochs. But, with our new-found tool for discerning objective truths in the world – Science – the veracity of The Bible
                has since become dubious for many.
                <br>
                It interestingly remains the case, however, that when their children are born, those same people do not say to them, “<i>The world is there
                for manipulation. The more you exploit, the more fulfilling your life will be. You should always lie, cheat and deceive
                as many people as you possibly can.</i>” No, rather, they edify them to do the exact opposite.
                They furthermore tell them things like, “<i>it doesn’t matter whether you win or lose, it’s how you play the game.</i>”
                Why do parents say these things if they can’t provide even a vague explanation for their utility? Can they even explain their utility without implicitly invoking The Bible and its associated injunctions?</p>
                
                <p>Suppose that we are at the beginning of our <i>Homo Sapiens</i> lineage. There are an infinite number of ways in which we could
                act. Perhaps we could choose not to share any of our food with the tribe, perhaps we could kill one of our friends if
                they were being particularly annoying that day, or perhaps we could choose not to aid our tribe by taking on our share
                of the tasks and responsibilities. All of these are equally feasible. Though, whilst reading, you will have probably
                already decided that none of them are beneficial and worthwhile.
                <br>
                Human beings have observed the social and individual consequences of their actions for millennia. Over this span of
                time, it became apparent that some acts are more laudable than others. Perhaps not sharing your food with the tribe, for example,
                entails that they, in turn, will not offer you any food in the future. Lessons such as these can then be passed
                down through generations, in the form of stories, with the purpose of continuing social functioning.
                <br>
                It is not, however, until after the story of an action has been told, that the ethic embedded within it can be derived
                and made explicit. It is therefore the case that the injunction to ‘tell the truth’, for example, probably took tens of
                thousands of years to be crystallised from a vague abstraction into a short phrase.</p>
                
                <p>As I understand it, then, The Bible is a collation of complicated stories that individually and collectively constitutes
                a rubric as for how to treat others and live an amicable life. Promulgated, as it must, through the medium of story.</p>

                <p>Thus, when parents of today tell their kids that ‘<i>it doesn’t matter whether you win or lose, what matters is how you
                play the game</i>’, it becomes clear that what they are really saying is that the personality of someone who prioritises
                playing the game truthfully and respectfully, is better than the personality of someone who is fixated on
                winning by any means necessary. Given that life is not one game, but a series, perhaps it is better to play in a manner
                that is conducive towards being invited back by your peers to all the other games, than to abandon your ethical
                principles in the myopic interest of winning only once. It is a moral statement. And one which is clearly redolent of certain essential
                tenets of The Bible.</p>

                <p>Is it true, <i>objectively</i>, that what really matters is how you play the game, not whether you win or lose? Maybe. Maybe not.
                But, as already mentioned, from a psychological perspective, the objective verisimilitude of such a phrase is in fact
                trivial. What matters instead, is whether the phrase is <i>metaphorically</i> true: that is, does behaving <i>as if</i> it were true happen to
                serve you better than behaving as if it were false? If so, then I believe you can say that it is true at a deeper, more
                important, level than that of mere objectivity.</p>

                <p>So the parents of today <i>are</i> edifying their kids (consciously or otherwise) with Christian-like virtues. And it is for this
                reason that I believe the ethos of The Bible still permeates our culture, whether we like it or not.</p>

                <p>And it is with this that I conclude by summarising that although The Bible is almost certainly objectively false, its
                longevity is a testament (no pun intended) to being largely metaphorically true, and for <i>that</i> reason, religion has
                utility, and always will.</p>
