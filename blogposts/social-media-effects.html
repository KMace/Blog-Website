            <h2 class="article-subtitle">Can the brain distinguish between the virtual and material world?</h2>
            <div class="article-content">
                <p>It appears that with each passing day, we are becoming ever more consumed by technology. From January 2020 to 21
                    alone, some 490 million additional social media accounts were created. Would it be reasonable to assume that
                    there are no disadvantages whatsoever associated with social media? Are there better things – perhaps necessary
                    developmental things – that children should be doing, instead of scrolling through ‘Tiktok’ for ten hours a day?
                    I believe so. And I don't think I am alone in that belief either. Which makes how little research there is into
                    the developmental effects of social media on children all the more suprising.</p>
            
                <p>The fundamental claim for my (particularly unsophisticated) hypothesis is that it is very difficult for the brain
                    of an individual who has grown up with social media – suppose they were given a phone at the age of six, a by no
                    means uncommon sight in restaurants or supermarkets – to distinguish between a virtual like on 'Instagram', and
                    a verbal, face-to-face compliment. I do not know the neuroscience underlying either scenario, but I think I
                    can reasonably suspect that there are at least two neurochemicals at play: dopamine and serotonin.</p>
            
                <p>Serotonin, as I understand, is the neurochemical which regulates the amount of positive and negative emotion you
                    feel, as a consequence of the body’s perception of its relative position within the social hierarchy. This is to
                    say that the ascension to, or the mere occupying of, a high position within a hierarchy evokes an increase in
                    serotonin, and consequently allows you to feel more positive emotion and less negative emotion. The opposite
                    of course evoking a <i>de</i>-crease in serotonin. 
                    <br>
                    Given the following: (1) that, arguably, our primary mode of interaction with humans throughout the course of a day now takes place online; and (2) the human brain does not stop developing until the mid-twenties, consider what an unexpectedly high number of likes on a social media post signifies to the brain of someone who has been using it since age six. To them, it is surely an explicit indication that they have ascended the social hierarchy, because they are now receiving an unprecedented number of people telling them, <i>"I approve of this; I approve of you; I approve of what you are doing"</i>. I would posit, therefore, that their brain secretes more serotonin in response.
                    <br>
                    The implication of this being, of course, that an unexpectedly low number of likes indicates a
                    <i>de</i>-scension in hierarchy position. And as such, it comes as no surprise that shortly after uploading to
                    Instagram, people will text most if not all of their contacts, telling them to, “like recent”; or alternatively,
                    they will outright delete the post within a few minutes after upload, if it did not satisfy the number of likes
                    that they expected it to receive.
                </p>
            
                <p>Dopamine, for its part, is the neurochemical associated with pleasure, reward and motivation. It is secreted partly in accordance with one’s expectations towards the outcome of an event.
                    <br>
                    Interestingly, if a particular player of a victorious sports team did not expect to win beforehand, then their
                    dopamine levels would be markedly higher than that of before the game. However, if an individual of that same
                    team 'knew' they were going to win beforehand, but expected their performance to be much better, then their
                    dopamine levels would be <i>lower</i> than that of before the game, despite the fact of their victory! The
                    psychological valence of an event outcome is thus entirely determined by one’s initial expectations towards it.
                    <br>
                    I would therefore suspect that dopmaine, with its role in anticipatory reward and pleasure, plays a fundamental
                    role in (1) the exultation or disenchantment people feel as a result of their Instagram likes; and (2) the
                    inherent difficulty of outright attempting to relinquish social media.
                </p>
            
                <p>Suppose that the neurochemical effects just described are even somewhat akin to those that would take place in
                    the brain of a person who has just been complimented, in-person, by hundreds of people. Then I believe that I have bolstered my aforementioned central claim: that it is very difficult, if not impossible, for the brain of an
                    individual, born into social media, to be capable of accurately distinguishing between an explicit face-to-face
                    compliment and a mere virtual like.</p>
            
                <p>If so, what are the implications of this, I wonder? The phenomena of being incapable of either going to the toilet for
                    thirty seconds without a phone, or eating a meal without first posting its picture online, certainly seem to
                    validate Elon Musk's proposition that we now perceieve our phone as a physical extension of ourselves. What,
                    then, will habits such as these, conducive as they are to the deprivation of human interaction throughout one’s
                    developmental period, entail for the future? Put differently, what salutary effects can it possibly be having for a child if they are no longer going outside, no longer
                    practicing in-person conversation, no longer interacting with the other sex (young adults are having less sex
                    today than ever before), and are now predicating their intrinsic worth on the number of likes their Instagram post of
                    last night received? </p>
                    
                <p>
                    I believe that we are beginning to get a glimpse.
                    <br>
                    Tragically, we often hear of people that have died whilst trying to take an edgy selfie that would've garnered a lot of likes. Self-reported anxiety
                    rates have increased from 7.97% to 14.66% among 18-25 year olds, from 2008 to 2018. This was the largest
                    increase out of any other age group, which is not at all suprising for reasons which by now should be clear. It
                    is furthermore not uncommon for old people to remark that 'the young people of today have lost the art of
                    conversation'. And once you start to look, it really seems as though we have: I cannot recall the last time I
                    was sat at a resaurant table with friends and at least one person was not on their phone whilst we were talking
                    (I am not claiming to be exempt).
                </p>

                <p>In my estimation, we need to collectively wake up and render taboo certain things such as being on your phone at
                    the table. Parents should resist the temptation to use technology to prevent their childs boredom. If their
                    child <i>does</i> use technology, they should introduce a set amount of time for them to use it; with the
                    remaining time to be filled with creative activities such as going outside or playing with siblings. I say this with full cognisance that technology is only going to become more convenient and is therefore only going to encroach on more aspects of our lives, as companies are not going to cease developing their products any time soon.
                    <br><br>
                    But this is exactly why we must rouse our friends <i>not</i> later, but now - whilst it is easier to do so, and
                    whilst pathological, technological habits are not nearly as entrenched as they are otherwise sure to become.
